# LogicStatementTester
A web based mathematical logic statement evaluator.

Live version can be found here: http://isti115.github.io/LogicStatementTester/

This was made as a homework for my university studies.  
You can give a mathematical logic statement as input, and it evaluates all the possible variable value combinations to find if it always has the same result, or it can have different outcomes.
